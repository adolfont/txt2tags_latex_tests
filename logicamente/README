Instructions:
  Run generate_pdf.sh (a bash shell script) and view the generated PDF.


Comments:

This document (syntax_tree.t2t) illustrates the use of:

1. ''tagged'' marks

2. Three apostrophes blocks:

'''
three
apostrophes
blocks
'''

3. Post-processing commands:
%!postproc(tex)

4. Including footnotes (\footnote{...})

5. Including figures (\begin{figure}...\end{figure})

6. Using bibtex (\cite{...})

7. Defining commands (\newcommand{...}{...})


The txt2tags source is cleaner than the latex source? I am not so sure...
